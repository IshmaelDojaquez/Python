import math # module with a ton of math functions that we can now use

x = 2.9
round(x)  # will round the number
abs(-2.9)  # will always turn the positive version of whatever is passed in
# we can now use math. + whatever function we want to use from the import math
print(math.ceil(2.9))
print(math.floor(2.9))

# docs.python will have all the functions available and is a good research tool
